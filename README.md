My configuration files for vim, etc. that I use on various machines.

A lot of my .vimrc is lifted from [Ryan Tomayko's configuration][rtomayko]
so thanks to him for providing such an invaluable resource.

## Usage

As my Vim plugins are managed with [Vundle][], you will need to run the following command inside vim once you have cloned this repository:

    :BundleInstall
