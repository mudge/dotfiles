My configuration files for vim, etc. that I use on various machines.

A lot of my .vimrc is lifted from [Ryan Tomayko's configuration][rtomayko]
so thanks to him for providing such an invaluable resource.

## Usage

As my Vim plugins are managed with [Vundle][], you will first need to install it like so:

    $ git clone http://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle

And then run the following command inside vim:

    :BundleInstall
